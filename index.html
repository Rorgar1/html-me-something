        <p>In March, 2018, I had the 
          opportunity to accompany my husband on a business 
          trip to Sweden and Denmark. I knew nothing about
         Sweden except the meatballs and fish. Scandinavia
         in March is cold, and gray, but still has a bleak
         sort of beauty. One understands how the Vikings 
         became so fierce. The people of Sweden today are 
         still slow to warm up to strangers, but once you
         make a connection, they are among the most welcoming
         people I have met.<br>
         By the end of the trip, Scandinavia became my new favorite vacation 
         destination.</p>

        <h2>Kristianstad, Sweden</h2>

        </figure>
        <p>Kristianstad is a tiny town with a long history.
           We spent a week here while my husband worked. 
           I explored the shops, museum, and many 
           coffeehouses. In Sweden, there is something 
           called "fika", when one sits down over a coffee 
           and sweet roll to stop and enjoy life, and maybe 
           read a book or newspaper for a few hours. 
           Fika is my new favorite meal. 
           
          <br>I was surprised that everyone I met chose to 
          speak English rather than Swedish. Even the signs
           were written in English and Swedish, so it was 
           easy to feel right at home.</p>

        <h2>Lund, Sweden</h2>

        </figure>
        <p>About an hour from the big city of Copenhagen 
          is the city of Lund, known for its university 
          and the historic Kulturen museum. Kulturen has 
          architectural examples from the days when roofs
          were still covered with grass, up through to the
           last century.</p>
        <p>There are also Viking 
          skulls. Can't go to Scandinavia without 
          seeing Viking skulls.</p>

        <h2>Malm<span>&#246;</span>, Sweden</h2>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://github.com/Rorgar1/html-me-something/blob/master/images/IMG_4101.JPG?raw=true"
             alt="Malmo, Sweden">
        </figure>
        <p>Malm<span>&#246;</span> is just across a bridge from Copenhagen.
          But it is most definitely Swedish, not Danish, though 
          Denmark once claimed it. Malm<span>&#246;</span>hus is the old castle and
          now museum.
        </p>
        <p>Malm<span>&#246;</span> is even more beautiful in the snow. Yes, it
          snows in March. Spring doesn't arrive until mid-April,
           but there is nothing like a
          snowy day to enjoy fika!

        <h2>Copenhagen, Denmark</h2>

          <figcaption>The most-visited canal in Copenhagen</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>Copenhagen is a harbor city, and it has canals that 
          run through it. It is the Venice of Scandinavia. 
        </p>
        <p>Copenhagen is also the home of the famed writer 
          of fairy tales, Hans Christian Andersen. His well-known 
          Little Mermaid sits on a boulder in the harbor,
          waiting for her prince. 
        </p>
        <p>Did you know Denmark still has a royal family?
            It is one of the longest-reigning families in the
            world! Buckingham Palace has nothing on Amalienborg
            Palace. It is still the royal home, a museum,
            a historical building, and takes a full day to 
            explore. There is even a changing-of-the-guard 
            ceremony!

      <section>After two weeks, Scandinavia wove its charm 
        on us. The people, the places, the history, the 
        coffee, the ease of getting around. I would 
        go back in a heartbeat.
